## sin(x) table
Cathleen will go to a field trip with her classmates, which is to figure out the width of a river. They are going to use Law of Sin, which is a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C). We could see that they need to calculate sin(x). But a lot of Cathleen's classmates do not have scientific calculators. Cathleen asks Caroline for help and Caroline said that she will print a table for Cathleen. The table will contains the value of sin(x) for all x from 0 to 90 degree.

## sin(x) derivative table
Cathleen noticed that Caroline is learning Calculus and she also want to know the derivative. Caroline told Cathleen that she could provide Cathleen a derivative table for sin(x) for all of x from 0 to 90 degree. Once Cathleen has the table, Cathleen could look up the derivative values for that table.


## sin(x) integral
Computer is not as smart as human and a computer only knows integral by sum. Let's use a computer way to calculate the integral of sin(x). We should check how accurate a computer could calcuate integral. Once we figure the integral of sin(x), we could calculate integral of sqrt(sin(x)).
